# Phase 4 - Mockup Coverage Checklist

Synced date: 2026-08-10

## 1. Phase Scope

Phase 4 contains three confirmed features:

1. P4.1 Notifications.
2. P4.2 Project Access & Permissions.
3. P4.3 Settings & Audit.

This checklist verifies BA/mockup behavior. API, persistence and production security remain development-owned.

## 2. P4.1 Notifications

Approved behavior:

- Bell opens Notification Center.
- Filters are `All`, `Unread`, `Assigned` and `Mentions` only.
- US/DE assignment notifies the assigned user.
- Mentioning a user in a US/DE Note notifies that user and may show an in-app popup.
- Generic Notes, status changes, attachments, sprint updates and due dates do not create Phase 4 notifications.
- Clicking a notification or `Go to item` opens the related US/DE.
- Access is checked before target data is displayed.

## 3. P4.2 Project Access & Permissions

Approved model:

- `Workspace Admin` is the only company-level authority.
- Workspace Admin is assigned internally, is not a Project member and is excluded from Project user lists.
- Normal users receive `Admin` or `Editor` independently per Project.
