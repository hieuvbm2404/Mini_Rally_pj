# Phase 0 - Mockup Coverage Checklist

Synced date: 2026-08-10

## Confirmed Foundation

- Workspace is the fixed root context visible to users.
- App hierarchy is `Workspace -> Project -> Team`.
- A Team belongs to one parent Project in the current Mini Rally MVP.
- Main navigation is `Home -> Plan -> Track -> Quality -> Portfolio -> Reports` according to effective Project Access.
- Plan contains Backlog and Timeboxes; Track contains Iteration Status and Team Status.
- Team Board and Iteration Board remain Future Backlog.

## Access Reconciliation

- Workspace Admin is the only company-level authority and is assigned internally.
- Normal users receive Admin or Editor independently per Project.
- Only Workspace Admin manages Users, Projects, Teams, Project access and Team membership.
- Admin receives All Teams and delivery authority in assigned Projects; structure is read-only.
- Editor sees assigned Projects/Teams and approved delivery-editing surfaces.
- A user without a Project assignment cannot see or directly access that Project.
- The current authority is `Phase 4/02_Roles_Permissions/SRS.md`.

## Permission Acceptance

- [x] WA sees all administration and every Project/Team.
- [x] WA is excluded from Project membership lists.
- [x] Admin sees assigned Project and All Teams but cannot mutate structure/access.
- [x] Editor sees only assigned Project/Teams.
- [x] Unassigned-user hidden/denied behavior is defined in SRS and test pack; Viewer/selectable No Access are Future Backlog.
- [x] User Details and Project Users & Permissions use one shared session state.
- [x] Add Team can set Admin/Editor access and synchronize membership.
- [ ] Production API/service enforcement remains DEV/QA verification.

## Production Notes

- Frontend role-switch and local state are mockup evidence only.
- Backend must enforce Project, Team and action scope; UI gating is only UX.
- Production lists require authorized server-side filtering and pagination.
- Project access changes take effect next sign-in; company disable/removal takes effect next refresh.
