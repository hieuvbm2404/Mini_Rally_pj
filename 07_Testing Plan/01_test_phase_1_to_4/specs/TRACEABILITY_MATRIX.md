## Cross-phase critical chains

| Chain | Covered by | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Auth -> fixed Company -> Project create | `E2E-001` | Confirms Phase 0 usable foundation. |
| Project -> Team -> User Access -> Backlog | `E2E-002`, `P4-ACCESS-*`, `E2E-003` | Confirms WA setup is synchronized before delivery work begins. |
| Backlog Story/Defect -> Detail -> Task/Time/Activity | `E2E-003`, `E2E-004`, `E2E-005` | Confirms core work item management. |
| Backlog item -> Iteration assignment -> Iteration Status | `E2E-006` | Confirms Phase 2 source-of-truth design. |
| Iteration Status Add Item -> Backlog visibility | `E2E-007` | Confirms direct execution flow still creates normal Backlog item. |
| Context switch isolation | `E2E-008` | Prevents cross-project/team data leakage. |
| Per-Project access isolation | `E2E-008`, `E2E-009`, `P4-RBAC-*` | Confirms one Project's Admin/Editor assignment never leaks into an unassigned Project. |
| Deferred scope guard | `E2E-010` | Prevents Phase 3 scope from blocking Phase 2 acceptance. |
| Team Status task roll-up | `E2E-011`, `E2E-012` | Confirms task completion updates parent Work Item and Iteration status without removing manual control. |
| Release artifact assignment | `E2E-013` | Confirms Release uses existing Story/Defect work items and one active Release assignment. |
| Milestone artifact assignment | `E2E-014` | Confirms Milestone artifacts are assigned Story/Defect work items independent from Release assignment. |
| Quality Defect lifecycle | `E2E-015` | Confirms Quality and Backlog Defect share one work item source. |
| Future Backlog guard | `E2E-016` | Prevents Team Board from becoming a hidden Phase 3/4 blocker. |
| Full reconciled Agile lifecycle | `E2E_AGILE_LIFECYCLE_RECONCILIATION.md` | Proves Release/Milestone, Iteration, Backlog, Tasks, roll-up, metrics and cross-screen status as one chain. |

## Coverage summary

| Phase | Covered business areas | Main open verification dependency |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0 | Auth, app shell, fixed Company, Project CRUD | Environment/account availability and permission-role test users. |
| Phase 1 | Manage, Backlog, Create, Detail, Task, Time, Content, Attachment, Activity | Seed data and storage/email config for attachments/invitations. |
| Phase 2 | Context filter, Backlog Enhancement, Iterations, Iteration Status | Iteration data and Work Item assignment API/runtime availability. |
| Phase 3 | Team Status, Release Management, Milestones, Quality/Defect | Phase 2 Work Item/Iteration data plus Release/Milestone/Defect test data. |
| Phase 4 | Notifications, Project Access, synchronized administration journeys, Settings and Audit | WA plus normal users with Admin/Editor assignments and at least one unassigned Project across multiple Projects and Teams. |
