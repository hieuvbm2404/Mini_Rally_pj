## E2E-006 - Backlog item enters Iteration and appears in Iteration Status

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 1 + Phase 2 |
| Priority | P0 |
| Actor | Workspace Admin/Admin creates Iteration; Admin/Editor assigns Work Item |

## E2E-008 - Context isolation regression

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 |
| Priority | P0 |
| Actor | Normal user with assignments that differ across Projects |
| Preconditions | Project A is assigned Admin/Editor; Project B has no assignment; Teams have distinct data |

### Steps

1. Select Project A / Team A.
2. Capture Backlog items, Iterations and Iteration Status selector.
3. Confirm Project B/Team B is absent from navigation and selectors.
4. Try direct URL to Project B and one of its Work Items.
5. Add Project B as Editor with one Team as Workspace Admin, sign in again and reopen it.

### Expected result

- Unassigned Project/Team/data does not leak through lists, search or selectors.
- Direct unauthorized access returns safe Access Denied/Not Found without metadata.
- After next sign-in, Editor sees only assigned Project B Teams and approved delivery actions.

## E2E-009 - Access in one Project does not grant another Project

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 0 + Phase 1 + Phase 2 |
| Priority | P1 |
| Actor | Normal user |
| Preconditions | User is Admin in Project A and has no assignment in Project B |

### Steps

1. Login as the test user.
2. In Project A, verify delivery management and All Teams.
3. Confirm Project/Team/access structural controls remain unavailable.
4. Search/select/navigate directly to Project B data.
5. If possible, call a direct Project B read and mutation endpoint with that session.

### Expected result

- Project A Admin access does not reveal Project B.
- Project B direct access is denied safely for both reads and mutations.
- Project A structural Project/Team/access controls remain WA-only.

## E2E-010 - Deferred scope guard

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 1 + Phase 2 |
| Priority | P1 |
| Actor | BA / Workspace Admin |
| Preconditions | App navigation available |

### Steps

1. Inspect Backlog create type options.
2. Inspect Timeboxes type options.
3. Inspect Track navigation.
4. Inspect Release/Milestone/Team Status routes if visible.
5. Inspect Team Board only as a Future Backlog placeholder if visible.

### Expected result

- Backlog create supports Story/Defect only in Phase 1/2.
- Timeboxes Phase 2 shows Iterations only.
- Team Status, Release Management, Milestones and Quality/Defect are Phase 3 scope, not required for Phase 2 acceptance.
- Team Board is Future Backlog and is not required for Phase 2 or Phase 3 acceptance.

## E2E-011 - Team Status completes parent when all child Tasks complete

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 1 + Phase 2 + Phase 3 |
| Priority | P0 |
| Actor | Workspace Admin / Admin in assigned Project |
| Preconditions | Story/Defect is assigned to an Iteration and has at least two child Tasks |

### Steps

1. Open `Track -> Team Status`.
2. Select the Iteration containing the Story/Defect.
3. Complete only one child Task.
4. Verify parent Story/Defect status.
5. Complete all remaining child Tasks under the same parent.
6. Reopen parent Work Item Detail.

### Expected result

- Partial Task completion does not auto-complete parent Story/Defect.
- When all child Tasks are `Completed`, parent Story/Defect auto-completes to `Completed`.
- Reopening a Task after that all-completed state recalculates metrics and auto-moves the parent Story/Defect to `In-Progress`.
- Parent identity, Iteration assignment, rank, comments and history are preserved.

## E2E-012 - Manual status control remains after auto status update

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 2 + Phase 3 |
| Priority | P0 |
| Actor | Workspace Admin / Admin in assigned Project |
| Preconditions | Story/Defect and Iteration have been auto-updated by completion rules |

### Steps

1. Complete all Tasks under a Story/Defect and confirm parent auto-completes.
2. Open parent Work Item Detail.
3. Manually change parent Schedule State to another valid value.
4. Manually change assigned Iteration status if permitted.
5. Accept all Story/Defect items assigned to an Iteration.
6. Verify Iteration status.

### Expected result

- Auto-complete is convenience behavior only.
- Authorized user can manually change parent Story/Defect status after auto-complete.
- When all assigned Story/Defect items are `Accepted`, system may auto-set Iteration to `Accepted`.
- User can still manually change Iteration status if permitted.
- No scope lock or dedicated carry-over workflow appears.

## E2E-013 - Release artifact assignment uses existing Work Items

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 2 + Phase 3 |
| Priority | P0 |
| Actor | Workspace Admin / Release Owner |
| Preconditions | At least two Releases and one Story/Defect exist |

### Steps

1. Open `Plan -> Timeboxes -> Releases`.
2. Create or open Release A and Release B.
3. Assign an existing Story/Defect to Release A.
4. Open Release A Artifacts.
5. Reassign the same Story/Defect to Release B.
6. Refresh Release A and Release B artifact lists.

### Expected result

- Release Artifacts list shows existing Story/Defect work items; no clone is created.
- A Story/Defect has only one active Release assignment.
- Reassignment removes the item from Release A and shows it under Release B.
- Release counters/roll-ups refresh and user receives success/error feedback.
- Release readiness is not system-calculated in Phase 3.2.

## E2E-014 - Release/Milestone relations and Work Item assignment stay independent

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 3 |
| Priority | P0 |
| Actor | Workspace Admin / Delivery Owner |
| Preconditions | At least two Releases, two Milestones and one Story/Defect exist |

### Steps

1. Create Releases and Milestones in either order.
2. Link multiple Releases to one Milestone and verify derived dates.
3. Assign one Release and two valid Milestones to a Story/Defect.
4. Change the Work Item Release and inspect the Milestone multi-select.
5. Remove only one Milestone relation.
6. Check the remaining Milestone, Release, Iteration, Tasks, status and Work Item identity.

### Expected result

- Release and Milestone do not own each other; their link is many-to-many and creation order is irrelevant.
- With no linked Release, Milestone Target dates are user-managed; with linked Releases, dates are derived and read-only from the Release window.
- One Work Item supports zero/one Release and zero/many Milestones.
- Existing Milestone selections survive Release change; only add-new options are filtered to Milestones related to the current Release.
- Adding/removing a Milestone relation does not mutate other Milestones, Release, Iteration, Tasks, status, rank or Work Item identity.

## E2E-015 - Quality Defect lifecycle shares Backlog source

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 1 + Phase 3 |
| Priority | P0 |
| Actor | Workspace Admin / QA |
| Preconditions | Project/Team context exists |

### Steps

1. Open `Quality -> Defect`.
2. Create a Defect without User Story.
3. Edit Severity, Priority, State, Flow State, Fixed In Build and Owner.
4. Open the same Defect from Backlog.
5. Move State through Submitted -> Open -> Fixed -> Closed.
6. Try delete or reopen behavior if visible.

### Expected result

- Quality Defect and Backlog Defect are the same Work Item.
- User Story is optional.
- Fixed In Build is optional manual text.
- Valid state transitions work.
- Delete is unavailable/rejected; reopen from Closed/Closed Declined is deferred unless BA later confirms rules.

## E2E-016 - Future Backlog scope guard

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Phases | Phase 2 + Phase 3 + Phase 4 + Future Backlog |
| Priority | P1 |
| Actor | BA / Workspace Admin |
| Preconditions | App navigation available |

### Steps

1. Inspect Track navigation and Iteration Status view controls.
2. Inspect Plan -> Timeboxes -> Releases list/detail.
3. Inspect Portfolio dropdown.
4. Review `Future_Backlog/01_Team_Board.md`, `02_Release_Planning.md` and `03_Iteration_Status_Board.md`.

### Expected result

- Team Board is not required for Phase 3 acceptance.
- Iteration Status uses List only; Board toggle, drag/drop, WIP limits and transition rules are not current MVP requirements.
- Phase 3 Release list/detail has no Release Progress column, percentage or widget.
- Portfolio contains Portfolio Items, Capacity Planning and Release Tracking. Release Tracking is not a second Release create/edit source; Release Planning remains Future Backlog.
- Deferred notes preserve direction without creating a current development obligation.
